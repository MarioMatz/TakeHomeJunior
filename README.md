# Junior Coding Take Home Task

## Intro
This project was written by our akquinet code monkeysÂ©. They don't have any experience in coding and best practices. 
As one can assume, this code has some potential to be refactored. 

The main purpose of this program is to read two csv files. One is a movie database and the other one is 
a rating system for the movies. The program asks you to enter a movie id, from which it will search and calculate the 
average rating 

### Assignment
Please refactor this code to a point, where you think, this code looks good. There is no need to hold onto any parts of 
the code. You can even rewrite it in another language. 

You can check if your refactorings work by running the provided tests. The test must not be altered.

### Status: WIP
First refactoring done. Check, if further requirements are existent to make second refactor step. Clarify:
-> multiple movie/rating files in future?
-> runtime requirement ?
-> what should the UserExperience be? Discuss that "keiner" case

then refactor:
-> Movie methods
-> add further unit tests and refactor "successTest" by new IntegrationTest (using Test.csvs or other sample data)
-> make Main better readable
